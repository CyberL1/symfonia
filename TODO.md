# To-do list for bitfl0wer

- Take care of gateway_task
- Find out how sequence numbers work and increment them properly
- Find out where the stupid opcode 2 send comes from
- On death of connection: Remove session id from database
  - Maybe this and the "create resumable" thing can be consolidated?
